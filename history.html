<p>Founded in 2020, Hoops for Kids Korogocho began as a simple dream shared by a few passionate youth and local coaches who believed in the power of basketball 
        to bring positive change. Growing up in Korogocho ‚Äî one of Nairobi‚Äôs most densely populated and 
        underserved areas ‚Äî they saw first-hand how children and teenagers lacked safe spaces, mentorship, and 
        constructive after-school activities.
With just one basketball and a dirt court, the initiative started with weekend training sessions that combined 
sports, life skills, and mentorship. The goal was simple: to give kids hope, discipline, and a reason to dream 
beyond their circumstances.
What began with 5 kids and 1 coach has now grown into a thriving program serving over 100 youth weekly. The 
community came together, volunteers joined, and through local and international support, HFK expanded to include 
tournaments, education support, and girls‚Äô empowerment through sports.
Today, Hoops for Kids Korogocho is more than just a basketball project ‚Äî it‚Äôs a movement that‚Äôs building the 
next generation of leaders, athletes, and changemakers in Korogocho and beyond.</p>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">2020 ‚Äì Humble Beginnings</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Hoops for Kids Korogocho began in 2020 with just one basketball and a small group of passionate youth and a local coach. The aim was simple ‚Äî to keep kids off the streets, provide a safe space to play, and help them believe in a brighter future.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">2021 ‚Äì Community Growth</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">As word spread, more children joined. Volunteers from the local community stepped in, helping introduce mentorship and life skills alongside basketball. The initiative began to take shape as a strong support system for youth.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">2022 ‚Äì Tournaments & Recognition</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">HFK hosted its first local tournaments, bringing together teams from surrounding neighborhoods. These events not only showcased talent but also promoted unity, teamwork, and pride. The program began gaining recognition and support from the broader community.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">2023 ‚Äì Empowering Girls</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Recognizing the need for inclusivity, HFK launched a Girls Empowerment program focused on encouraging girls to participate in sports and leadership. This marked a new chapter in ensuring equal opportunities for all children.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">2024 & Beyond ‚Äì Growing the Movement</h2>
    <p>Today, Hoops for Kids Korogocho serves over 100 youth each week. Through expanded training, mentorship, and community partnerships, the mission continues: to use basketball as a tool for hope, discipline, and transformation in the heart of Korogocho.</p>
